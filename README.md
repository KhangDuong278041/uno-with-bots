## Why did I make this?

An attempt at a free offline alternative to [UNO on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/) with some changes in rulesets. You can have intense UNO matches with bots anytime you want, especially when you don't have friends to play with.

The UNO Flip deck was implemented before the official game, and rulesets are inspired from them.
I made all of the game assets in Photoshop, with the exception of [gameplay background](https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthamm/2690293634).
